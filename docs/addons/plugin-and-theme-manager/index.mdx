# Plugin & Theme Manager

Multisite Ultimate: Plugin and Theme Manager

Edit or hide the meta information (title, author, thumbnail and description) of installed plugins and themes. Create categories for plugins and themes to allow your users to filter them and add a beautiful custom Plugins page to your users' panel.

To use the plugin, you can just navigate to your Plugins or Themes pages on your network admin and click on "Edit Plugin/Theme info".

## Installation

1. Upload 'ultimate-multisite-plugin-and-theme-manager' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in your WordPress Network Admin

## Usage Guide

Ultimate Multisite: Plugin and Theme Manager is a powerful **premium** Ultimate Multisite add-on that gives you full control over the way your network users see and interact with the plugin and theme options on your network.

This add-on serves three purposes:

  1. It lets you completely change the metadata of both plugins and themes. That includes name, description, author name, and even thumbnails!

  2. It lets you categorize plugins and themes, to allow your users to easily sort them out.

  3. It gives you the option to replace the old, boring plugins page with a new themes-like page with sorting by categories.

After downloading and installing it, a new tab - _Add-on Settings_ \- will show on Ultimate Multisite Settings page.

On your network _Plugins_ page you will now be able to edit all the plugins' meta information, such as name, author, and even the plugin's thumbnail.

Plugin and Theme Manager offers two display types: Plugin Style and Theme Style. So, finally, after making the adjustments you need, this is how your customers will see their _Plugins_ page:
