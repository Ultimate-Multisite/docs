_A brand new section appears!_

You can leave it blank to display all the languages as options or select which ones you'd like to make available. The languages are the ones you have installed in your WordPress set up.

## Setting the Language via the URL

You can also change the language of a page bypassing the locale parameter to the URL. If you want to redirect to a register page in Italian, for example, add ?locale=it_IT to the URL.

[https://yournetwork.com/wp-signup.php?locale=it_IT](https://yournetwork.com/wp-signup.php?locale=it%5FIT)

The language must be installed on your WordPress network for this to work.
