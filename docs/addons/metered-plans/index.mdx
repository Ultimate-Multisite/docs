# Metered Plans

The Ultimate Multisite: Metered Plans addon transforms how you bill your customers by introducing flexible metered billing capabilities. Instead of rigid hard limits that block users when exceeded, enable overage charges that automatically bill customers for additional usage.

## Key Features

* **Metered Billing**: Charge customers based on actual usage rather than fixed tiers
* **Overage Management**: Automatically bill for usage exceeding plan limits
* **Usage Tracking**: Monitor customer resource consumption in real-time
* **Flexible Pricing**: Set custom rates for different resources (storage, bandwidth, sites, etc.)
* **Automatic Invoicing**: Generate invoices automatically when usage thresholds are exceeded
* **Usage Reports**: Detailed usage analytics and reporting for customers and administrators

## Perfect For

* **Hosting Providers**: Offer scalable plans that grow with customer needs
* **SaaS Platforms**: Bill based on actual resource consumption
* **Agency Networks**: Flexible pricing models for client projects
* **Reseller Hosting**: Enable partners to offer usage-based pricing

## Frequently Asked Questions

## What happens when a customer exceeds their limit?

Instead of blocking access, the system tracks the overage and adds it to their next invoice based on the rates you've configured.

## Can I set different overage rates for different products?

Yes, each product can have unique metered resources and overage pricing.

## How are customers notified about usage?

Customers can view their current usage in their dashboard and receive optional notifications when approaching or exceeding limits.

## Can I still use hard limits?

Yes, metered billing is optional per product. You can mix traditional hard-limit products with metered products.
