# Support Agents

Managing an entire network by yourself is not an easy task. As your network starts to grow, you'll start to see increasing demand for support. It will be a good idea to bring in people that will help you lighten your workload. However, giving full access/permission is risky and may compromise your network. That is where this Support Agent add-on comes in.

This add-on allows you to create a new type of WordPress user called Support Agent, and gives you total control over what permissions that user has. Granting permission is as easy as turning on a toggle button and turning it off should you decide to remove it.

## Features

- Itemized list of WordPress & Ultimate Multisite permission
- Enable & disable access with ease
- Create unlimited number of Agent accounts

## Installation

1. Upload 'ultimate-multisite-support-agents' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Follow the step by step Wizard to set the plugin up
