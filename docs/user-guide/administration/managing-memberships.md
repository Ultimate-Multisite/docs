# Managing Memberships

In Ultimate Multisite you can manage memberships and access all the subscriptions on your network. Review and edit subscription details such as plans and products, the number of sites, billing amount and frequency, payment history, and timestamps.

To access this page, go to the **Memberships** tab in the Ultimate Multisite menu.

On the Memberships page you can see a list of your customers and the products associated with their accounts. You can filter memberships by status: active, pending, on hold, expired, or cancelled.

Click on a membership to access the page where you can edit the membership details — billing info, site or visit limits, and more.

You can also add new memberships associated with users previously registered on your network. Click **Add Membership** and configure the details.
