# Managing System Emails

Ultimate Multisite sends various system emails for events like signup confirmations, payment receipts, and membership changes. You can customize these email templates to match your brand.

## Viewing System Emails

Navigate to **Ultimate Multisite → Settings** and click on the **Emails** tab to see email-related settings.

From there, you can access the **System Emails** page to see all email templates.

## Importing New Email Templates

New Ultimate Multisite versions and add-ons may register new email templates. To prevent conflicts, new templates are not automatically added — you need to import them manually.

To import new email templates:

1. Go to the **System Emails** page
2. Click the **Reset & Import** button at the top of the page
3. Toggle the **Import Emails** option to see available templates
4. Select the templates you want to import and confirm

## Resetting Email Templates

If you've customized an email template and want to revert to the default content, you have two options:

1. **Delete and re-import** — Delete the system email and import it again (this erases send metrics)
2. **Reset via the tool** — Use the **Reset & Import** tool, toggle the **Reset** option, and select the emails you want to reset

The Reset option is preferred as it preserves send metrics and other metadata while restoring the default content.
