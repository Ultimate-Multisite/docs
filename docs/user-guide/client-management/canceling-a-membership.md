# Canceling a Membership (v2)

_**IMPORTANT NOTE: This article refers to Ultimate Multisite version 2.x.**_

Canceling a membership on your customers side is pretty easy.

If your user wants to cancel their membership, they should first access their ****Account**** page.

There, they should click head to the **Danger Zone** , and click to **Delete Account**.

A module will open asking for their confirmation. They should toggle the **Confirm Account Deletion** option on and click to **Delete Account**.

This will log them out of the site and cancel their membership on your network, as well as delete their site from your network.

**Important:** Notice that this action will not exclude the customer from your network, since a customer can have more than one membership or none membership linked to them.
