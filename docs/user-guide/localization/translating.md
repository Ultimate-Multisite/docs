# Translating Ultimate Multisite

Ultimate Multisite is developed in English, but the plugin is fully translatable and we actively welcome translation contributions.

## Core Plugin Translations

The core Ultimate Multisite plugin is translated through the official **WordPress.org translation platform**:

**[translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/ultimate-multisite/](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/ultimate-multisite/)**

This is the standard WordPress community translation system. When translations reach a sufficient approval threshold, they are automatically distributed to all Ultimate Multisite users through WordPress plugin updates.

**We need your help!** If you speak a language other than English, please consider contributing translations. Even translating a few strings helps. To get started:

1. Visit [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/ultimate-multisite/)
2. Select your language
3. Click "Contribute Translation"
4. You'll need a free WordPress.org account

If you'd like to become a translation editor for your language (able to approve translations), reach out via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Ultimate-Multisite/ultimate-multisite/discussions).

## Addon Translations

Addon plugins are translated separately at:

**[translate.ultimatemultisite.com](https://translate.ultimatemultisite.com/)**

The addon translations are currently AI-generated as a starting point. They cover all supported languages but may contain awkward phrasing or inaccuracies. We welcome human translators to review and suggest improvements to make them more natural and accurate.

## Local Translations

If you prefer to create translations locally for your own project rather than contributing upstream, there are two options:

### Using Poedit

You can use the desktop application **[Poedit](https://poedit.net)** to translate the `.pot` file:

1. Download Poedit from [poedit.net](https://poedit.net)
2. Open the `.pot` file from `wp-content/plugins/ultimate-multisite/lang/`
3. Translate the strings in the Poedit interface
4. Save -- Poedit generates `.po` and `.mo` files
5. Place the output files in the `lang` folder

### Using Loco Translate

The **[Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/)** WordPress plugin lets you translate directly from the admin panel without any desktop tools. It handles creating and compiling translation files for you.
