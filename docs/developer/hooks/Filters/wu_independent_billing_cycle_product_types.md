# Filter: wu_independent_billing_cycle_product_types

Filter the product types that have independent billing cycles.

Products with independent billing cycles are not forced to match the plan's billing period in the cart. This is useful for products like domain registrations that always bill yearly regardless of whether the plan is monthly or annual.

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| $types | `array` | Array of product types with independent billing cycles. |
