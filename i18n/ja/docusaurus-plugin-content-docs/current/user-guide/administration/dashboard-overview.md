# Dashboard Overview

Ultimate Multisite has a dedicated **Dashboard** under the Ultimate Multisite menu, and also adds widgets to the Network Dashboard. This article covers what you'll see in both places.

## The Network Dashboard

Ultimate Multisite injects useful widgets into the network-level dashboard found at **My Sites → Network Admin → Dashboard**.

Here's what each widget provides:

**First Steps:** Appears on a fresh installation and reminds you to complete setup tasks like configuring a payment method and creating a test account.

**Summary:** Reports the number of signups and revenue for the day. The MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) indicates a projected total across customers with revenue-generating memberships.

**Activity Stream:** Reports on events across Ultimate Multisite — signups, cancellations, site creations, deletions, and other activities.

## The Ultimate Multisite Dashboard

While the network dashboard presents holistic information about the network, the Ultimate Multisite dashboard (at the top-level of the Ultimate Multisite menu) presents information about the service.

**Monthly Recurring Revenue Growth:** Displays a monthly breakdown of revenue over a 12-month calendar period. New revenue is shown in blue while cancellations appear in red.

**Date-range Support:** Filter dashboard data by time period to focus on the information you need. The date range controls what's displayed in the widgets below.

The dashboard widgets include:

- **Revenue** — Total revenue for the period with MRR and per-product breakdowns
- **New Memberships** — How many new memberships were created in the selected period
- **Signups by Countries** — Geographic breakdown of signups
- **Signups by Forms** — How many customers signed up via each checkout form vs. added by admins
- **Most Visited Sites** — The most visited sites on your network (requires enabling visit counting at **Ultimate Multisite → Settings → Sites → Enable Visits Limitation and Counting**)
