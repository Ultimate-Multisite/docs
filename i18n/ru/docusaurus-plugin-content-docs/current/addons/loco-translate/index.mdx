# Loco Translate

2. Install and activate the Loco Translate plugin

## Frequently Asked Questions

## Do I need to configure anything after installation?

No! The integration is automatic. Once both the addon and Loco Translate are active, subsites can immediately start creating their own custom translations.

## What happens if a subsite doesn't create custom translations?

The site will automatically use network-wide translations as a fallback. Nothing breaks, and everything works seamlessly.

## Can subsites access network-wide translations?

Regular site admins only see and edit their own site’s translations. Super admins can access both network-wide and site-specific translations depending on which site they’re viewing.

## Does this work with both plugins and themes?

Yes! Site-specific translations work for both WordPress plugins and themes.

## Will this slow down my multisite network?

No. The addon uses efficient file loading that only checks for site-specific translations when needed. There's no noticeable performance impact.

## Can I copy network translations to a specific site as a starting point?

Yes! While editing translations in Loco Translate, you can easily start with network translations and customize them for each site.

## Does this work with WooCommerce and other plugins?

Absolutely! Any plugin or theme that uses standard WordPress translation functions will work with site‑specific translations.
