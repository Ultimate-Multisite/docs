The only way to get a non‑zero value is to have a term that contains the factor \(x\) in the numerator.  
The denominator is a product of powers of \((x-1)\) and \((x+1)\); it never introduces a factor of \(x\).  
Hence the only possible source of an \(x\) in the numerator is the factor \((x-1)^{\,n-1}\) in the first term of the numerator.

For this factor to contribute an \(x\) we must have

\[
n-1=1 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad n=2 .
\]

For \(n=2\) the numerator contains the factor \(x\) and the denominator does not cancel it, so the limit is non‑zero.  
For any other integer \(n\) the numerator has no factor of \(x\), so the limit is zero.

\[
\boxed{\,n=2\,}
\]
