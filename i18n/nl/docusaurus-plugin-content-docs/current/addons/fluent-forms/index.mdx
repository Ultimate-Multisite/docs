# Fluent Forms

This add-on makes it possible to add limits to Fluent Forms on Multisite Ultimate in products, memberships or sites.  
Fluent Forms uses custom tables instead of custom post types so the normal limiting options do not work with Fluent Forms.

## Features

- Add limits for Fluent Forms or Conversational Fluent Forms  
- Customers get a friendly message prompting them to upgrade their plan when they reach the limit
