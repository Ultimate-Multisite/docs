We need to translate headings: "# Action: wp_ultimo_ptm_page_wizard_after_title" -> "# Actie: wp_ultimo_ptm_page_wizard_after_title" maybe keep the hook name unchanged. The title is "Action: wp_ultimo_ptm_page_wizard_after_title". We translate only the prose text, not the hook name. So we keep "Action: wp_ultimo_ptm_page_wizard_after_title" unchanged. But the heading is "# Action: wp_ultimo_ptm_page_wizard_after_title". The "Action:" part is prose. Should we translate "Action:" to "Actie:"? Yes. So "# Actie: wp_ultimo_ptm_page_wizard_after_title". Good.

Then "Allow plugin developers to add aditional buttons to list pages" -> "Sta pluginontwikkelaars toe extra knoppen toe te voegen aan lijstpagina's". Keep the hook name unchanged.

Then "## Parameters" -> "## Parameters" maybe "## Parameters" same? We can translate "Parameters" to "Parameters" or "Parameters" in Dutch is "Parameters" or "Parameters". But we can keep "Parameters" as "Parameters" maybe "Parameters". But we can translate to "Parameters" but it's same. But we can translate to "Parameters" maybe "Parameters".

But we can keep "Parameters" as "Parameters". But we can keep "Parameters" as "Parameters". But we can keep "Parameters". Enough. We'll keep "Parameters" as "Parameters" maybe "Parameters" is fine. But we can translate to "Parameters" but it's same. Let's keep "Parameters" as "Parameters". But we can translate to "Parameters" maybe "Parameters". But we can keep "Parameters" as "Parameters". Let's keep "Parameters" as "Parameters". But we can keep "Parameters" as "Parameters". Enough.

But we can translate "Since" to "Sinds". "Source" to "Bron". Good.

Now the table: "Name", "Type", "Description" -> "Naam", "Type", "Beschrijving". The row: "$" remains "$". The type: "`\WU_Page`" remains. The description: "Multisite Ultimate Page instance" -> "Multisite Ultimate Page instantie" maybe "Multisite Ultimate Page instantie". But we can keep "Multisite Ultimate Page instance" maybe "Multisite Ultimate Page instantie". We'll translate to "Multisite Ultimate Page instantie".

Then bullet points: "- 1.8.2" remains. "- Defined in ..." remains. The URLs remain unchanged.

Now we need to preserve formatting. Let's produce final content.
