**The Secret Agent Cat and the Laser Chase**

In the quiet town of Willowbrook, there lived a sleek gray cat named Whiskers. By day he chased bright red laser pointers, leaping and pouncing with gleeful swish‑tails. But when the moon rose, Whiskers slipped into his secret agent costume—tiny sunglasses, a tiny cape, and a tiny badge that read “Agent Purr‑fect.”

One night, a mischievous mouse named Milo stole the mayor’s prized pie. Whiskers, with his laser pointer in paw, followed the trail of crumbs. He darted through the garden, leapt over the fence, and finally caught Milo in a dramatic laser‑light trap. Milo squeaked, “You’re a good cat!” and returned the pie.

The mayor thanked Whiskers, and the town celebrated with a big cat‑friendly feast. Whiskers purred, “A good chase is a good adventure, but a good deed is the best reward.”

**Moral:** Chase your dreams, but always remember to share your success with others.
