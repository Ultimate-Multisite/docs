# WooCommerce Integration

The WooCommerce Integration works in a very similar way to the way our Manual Gateway works. It offers a ton of flexibility to your users, allowing them to choose any of the payment forms available on your WooCommerce install. And it's simple: once the user billing period ends, the user subscription is put on hold. At the same time, an order will be created on the WooCommerce install of the main site of the network. The user then receives an invoice in their email, with a link to perform the payment. Once the payment is received, the subscription is renewed.

## Features

- Easy integration between Ultimate Multisite and WooCommerce
- Several payment methods available
- Completely automated process with WooCommerce Subscriptions

## Usage Guide

_**중요 공지: 이 문서는 Ultimate Multisite 버전 2.x를 참조합니다.**_

_**주의:** Ultimate Multisite: WooCommerce Integration은 메인 사이트에서 최소한 WooCommerce가 활성화되어 있어야 합니다._

우리는 _Stripe_와 _PayPal_이 일부 국가에서 사용 불가능하여 Ultimate Multisite 사용자가 플러그드를 효과적으로 사용하지 못하도록 제한하거나 방해한다는 것을 이해합니다. 그래서 우리는 _WooCommerce_를 통합하는 **애드온**을 만들었습니다.

WooCommerce는 매우 인기 있는 전자상거래 플러그인입니다. 전 세계 개발자들이 다양한 결제 게이트웨이를 통합하는 애드온을 만들었습니다. 우리는 이를 활용하여 Ultimate Multisite 청구 시스템에서 사용할 수 있는 결제 게이트웨이를 확장했습니다.

## Setting It Up

First, you need to install the WooCommerce Integration add-on which is **free for licensed users**. To install it, click on Ultimate Multisite on your super admin dashboard and select **Add-ons**.

Here you can find all Ultimate Multisite add-ons. Click on the **Ultimate Multisite: WooCommerce Integration** add-on.

A window will pop up with the add-on details. Just click on **Install Now** *.*

After the installation is done, you will be redirected to the plugins page. Here, just click on **Network Activate** and the _WooCommerce_ add-on will be activated on your network.

After activating it, if you still don't have the WooCommerce plugin installed and activated on your website, **you will receive a reminder**.

Once installed, you will see an additional option under the Ultimate Multisite payments settings. You can then **활성화** the _WooCommerce_ option from there.

You can configure some basic settings like the display name that will show in the front end and instructions to guide your users in their checkout flow. Then you can go to your **Main site’s _WooCommerce_ settings** to enable and configure the payment gateway you prefer to use.

## How to manage the payment

The WooCommerce Integration works in a very similar way to the way our **Manual Gateway** works. The downside is that every payment must be paid manually at the end of the billing period. Here is how the flow works:

  * Once the user’s billing cycle ends, the membership is put **보류 중**. At the same time, an order will be created on the _WooCommerce_ install on your network’s main site.

  * Users then receive an invoice in their email, with a link to perform the payment (the link also appears on their billing history from their subsite dashboard). That link redirects the user to the _**WooCommerce**_ **checkout**, where users will be able to select one of the **available _WooCommerce_ gateways** in order to process their payment.

  * Once the payment is received, the membership is **갱신**되고, the payment is logged on Ultimate Multisite and the order is set to complete.

### Some Important Notes:

  * The default functionality of Ultimate Multisite still works with this integration form. For example, **Subscription Management** 화면에서 **환불 발행**을 하면 선택한 결제 양식을 사용해 WooCommerce에 환불을 요청합니다.

  * Ultimate Multisite : WooCommerce Integration은 WP‑Cron에 의존합니다. 대부분 잘 작동하지만 사이트 트래픽이 낮으면 cron이 예약된 이벤트를 확인하도록 트리거되지 않아 이벤트가 누락될 수 있으며, 이는 실행 지연을 초래할 수 있습니다.

## Woocommerce Subscriptions Plugin

Manually initiating a payment each month is not ideal for end-users to do as a subscription is expected to automatically recur every billing cycle. So we designed the WooCommerce Integration addon to **support the WooCommerce Subscriptions plugin**. This will automate the payment to make the transaction easier for your end-users.

All you need to do is **설치** the [Woocommerce Subscriptions plugin](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) and have it **활성화** on your main site. Then go back to Ultimate Multisite payments settings and **통합을 활성화**.

And that is it. Your end-users will no longer need to manually make a payment at the end of their billing cycle.

Aside from an order being created on your main site under _Woocommerce_ , it will also create a subscription for each account.
