Material WP is an admin theme developed to give you that look and feeling, helping you to provide your clients with a more customized Dashboard. Material WP is also part of Ultimate Multisite’s premium plugins core.

After **installing it**, go to your _Plugins_ page and click to activate it on your Network.

_**NOTE:**_ _If you just activate it, it will show on your client’s as an option that can be marked to add the theme only to that user._

Now, you have your admin interface completely redesign! You also have a new menu on the left column called Material WP
